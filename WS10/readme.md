# Workshop #10: Function Templates
Version 1.0

In this workshop, you are to code a function template to search through a compound type array and insert the matches found in the array, into a Collection of the same compound type.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

-	code a function template
-	implement a call to a function template
-	describe what you have learned in completing this workshop




## Submission Policy


The workshop is divided into one coding part and one non-coding part:

- Part 1 (**LAB**): A step-by-step guided workshop, worth 50% of the workshop's total mark
> Please note that the part 1 section is **not to be started in your first session of the week**. You should start it on your own before the day of your class and join the first session of the week to ask for help and correct your mistakes (if there are any).
- Part 2 (reflection): non-coding part. The reflection doesn't have marks associated with it but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).
## Due Dates

Depending on the section you are enrolled in, the submission due day of the week may shift a day or two. Please choose the "-due" option of the submitter program to see the exact due date of your section:

```bash
~profname.proflastname/submit 2??/wX/pY -due<ENTER>
```
- Replace **??** with your subject code (`00 or 44`)
- Replace **X** with Workshop number: [`1 to 10`]
- Replace **Y** with the part number: [`1 or 2`]

### Overall workshop due days
- day 1: Workshop open for preview<br/>
  (If you need to check your program with the submitter, you can use `-feedback` option to test the execution without submission)
- day 2: submission opens for both parts 1 and 2
- day 5: (end of day) Part 1 due
- day 8: (end of day) Part 2 due
- day 9: (end of day) submissions rejected

If at the deadline (end of day 8) the workshop is not complete, there is an extension of **one day** when you can submit the missing parts.  **The code parts that are submitted late receive 0%.**  After this extra day, the submission closes; if the workshop is incomplete when the submission closes (missing at least one of the coding or non-coding parts), **the mark for the entire workshop is 0%**.

## Citation

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top:<br />
**your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

### For work that is done entirely by you (ONLY YOU)

If the file contains only your work or the work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

### For work that is done partially by you.

If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment is given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrongdoing.

> - Add the citation to the file in which you have the borrowed code
> - In the 'reflect.txt` submission of part 2 (DIY), add exactly what is added to which file and from where (or whom).

> :warning: This [Submission Policy](#submission-policy) only applies to the workshops. All other assessments in this subject have their own submission policies.

### If you have helped someone with your code

If you have helped someone with your code. Let them know of these regulations and in your 'reflect.txt' of part 2 (DIY), write exactly which part of your code was copied and who was the recipient of this code.<br />By doing this you will be clear of any wrongdoing if the recipient of the code does not honour these regulations.

## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: the compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++11`: the code will be compiled using the C++11 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as follows to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind --show-error-list=yes --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ws
```

- `--show-error-list=yes`: show the list of detected errors
- `--leak-check=full`: check for all types of memory problems
- `--show-leak-kinds=all`: show all types of memory leaks identified (enabled by the previous flag)
- `--track-origins=yes`: tracks the origin of uninitialized values (`g++` must use `-g` flag for compilation, so the information displayed here is meaningful).

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.

> Note: All the code written in workshops and the project must be implemented in the **sdds** namespace, unless instructed otherwise.

### Custom code submission

If you have any additional custom code, (i.e. functions, classes etc) that you want to reuse in the workshop save them under a module called Utils (`Utils.cpp and Utils.h`) and submit them with your workshop using the instructions in the "[Submitting Utils Module](#submitting-utils-module)" section.

# Lab (Part 1, 100%)

Look at the code provided in the **Collection** template module, study it and understand it. The Collection class is a template that works like a dynamic array of objects and resizes itself as objects are added to it. The code snippet below demonstrates how Collection works:  
```C++
Collection<double> Cdbl;
Cdbl.add(1.23);
Cdbl.add(2.34);
Cdbl.add(3.45);
cout << "There are " << Cdbl.size() << " items in the Collection!" << endl;
for(int i=0; i< Cdbl.size();i++){
    cout << Cdbl[i] << endl;
}
```
Output:
```Text
There are 3 items in the Collection!
1.23
2.34
3.45
```
## Supplied Modules:
`ReadWrite` Module, `Collection` Module, `Employee` Module, `Student` Module and `Car` Module

**Do not modify these modules!**  Look at the code and make sure you understand them.


## `search` function template

Using the Collection template, Create a function template called **search** in a file called `search.h` that accepts four arguments:
- an array of objects (template)
- number of elements in the array
- a Cstring **key** value to search for
- A Collection reference of the same objects in the array (template)

The search function returns a bool that is true only if at least one match to the key is found in the array and false otherwise. 
The search function adds all the matches in the array to the Collection reference argument.


## the main module
Modify the main module and call the **search** function as the condition of the four **if** statements in the source code.
